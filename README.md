# üí´ About Me:
 Hello, I'm Swati Mahesh Kuravattimath, a dedicated Computer Science Engineering student at P.A. College of Engineering, Mangaluru (2022-2026), currently holding a CGPA of 9.21. My expertise lies in data analytics, web development, and cloud computing, with hands-on experience in Python, Java, SQL, Power BI, and Azure Cloud Services.

I am currently interning at Solukraft, where I focus on UI/UX design and front-end development using technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Previously, I completed a virtual internship at JP Morgan Chase, where I set up local development environments and worked on financial APIs. My project work includes developing an AI-based fraud detection system and creating an IoT-based smart dustbin for waste management, showcasing my proficiency in data visualization and machine learning integration.

In addition to my technical experience, I actively contribute to my college community. I serve as the Chairperson of the IEEE Computer Society, where I organize technical workshops on AI, cloud computing, and coding competitions. I am also the Report Manager for the Embed Club and Event Coordinator for the GLUG Club, where I lead hackathons and open-source technology events.

My technical interests include data science, digital marketing, and cloud technologies, and I am continuously advancing my skills through certifications and professional development.

Feel free to explore my projects, and I welcome any collaboration opportunities. Let‚Äôs connect!
